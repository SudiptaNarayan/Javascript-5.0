what is javascript and what does we use it for?

Javascript is a logic based programming language where we can create our code project functionality in that.

Javascrpt is a high level programming language to build web pages.

Now we use the ES6(echna speed 6) version of JS,in other words we call it vanila javascript.

Run time environment of JS is Node JS.


VARIABLE

Variable is a container which stores the data.
In JS we have 3 types of variables :
1) let
2) var
3) const


1) let : - It is a type of variable which is used for changing the 
           variable name later.
         - Now these days , most of the cases we used let for 
           creating variables.
         - Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for 
           most of the  cases.

2) var : - It is a type of variable which is also used for         changing the variable later stage. 
         -  It is used in the oldest browser so nowadays we do'nt 
            use it most of the times.

3) const : - Const is a type of variable where we cant change our 
             data further.
           - const means constant to store data like numbers , 
             integers etc...

task:

1) diff betn let and var.
2) diff betn var and const.
3) what do u mean by haisting.(when we dont declare value)
